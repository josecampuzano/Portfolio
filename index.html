    <h3> About Me </h3>
   <h4> Web Development </h4>
    <p> I first grew interested in Web Development when I learned that you can use it as a tool to generate meaningful and impactful services or products. Access to information and data is really important to me and I know that learning this new skill in web development will allow me to create tools that make information and data more accessible to the people who need them. I am excited about a career in Software Engineering because there is so much to learn and so many opportunities to create. </p>
    
    <p> In my past roles, I have successfuly worked in collaboration with my peers to pull off some extraordinart events for our community. We mobilized a group of 50 volunteers to host a carnival that 400+ people attended. This project really solidifed the importance of being able to collaborate, of being able to bounce ideas off one another, of being part of a team. I am looking forward to the collaboration with the people in my cohort. </p>
    <h4> Interests </h4>
    <p> On my down time I enjoy:</p>
    
    <ol>
     <li>Riding my bike</li>
     <li> Playing soccer with friends </li>
     <li> Hosting a Game Night </li>

    </ol>
